This site is fairly simple to code and absolutely NO coding knowledge is required in order to make it your working personal site. Most of the configuration and changes can be done in the "vars.css" file in the css directory(folder). You can change and modify all of the animations in the "animations.css" file in the css directory. All of your content(skills, name, navbar content) can easily be added to the "index.html" file with very minimal knowledge on how to edit HTML files. In case you are facing any issues with modifying this, then please reach out to me at: github@shubhang.info via email.
